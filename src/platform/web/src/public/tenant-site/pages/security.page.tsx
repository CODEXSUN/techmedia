    question: "Can operations access be limited by staff responsibility?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Sales, purchase, receipt, payment, reporting, approval, and administration actions can be shaped around the responsibilities assigned to each account."
  },
  {
    question: "What happens when an employee leaves or changes roles?",
    answer:
      "Their access can be changed while the company keeps its customer records, documents, pending work, status, and activity trail. A replacement can continue from the authorised business context instead of starting from memory."
  },
  {
    question: "Can important document changes be reviewed later?",
    answer:
      "Financial and compliance workflows are designed to keep important lifecycle actions traceable. The exact activity available depends on the document and the access granted to the signed-in user."
  },
  {
    question: "How are invoice mistakes reduced?",
    answer:
      "Reusable master data, visible totals, required-field validation, status, and review steps help the team catch incomplete or inconsistent details before final actions."
